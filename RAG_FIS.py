Thanks for clarifying. I’ll now prepare a script that reads enriched JSON files (with precomputed OpenAI embeddings), loads them into memory, and builds a local RAG pipeline to answer questions via LangChain and OpenAI—without re-embedding. The pipeline will output answers into a pandas DataFrame for programmatic use or reporting.

I'll let you know as soon as it's ready.


# RAG Pipeline using LangChain, FAISS, and OpenAI

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** enhances an LLM’s answers by retrieving relevant context from a knowledge base at query time. In this script, we implement a RAG pipeline with **LangChain** and **OpenAI**, using precomputed 1536-dimension embeddings (from models like *text-embedding-ada-002*) stored in JSON files. We leverage **FAISS** (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for fast vector similarity search. This allows us to avoid recomputing embeddings for our data and use them directly for retrieval. The pipeline will:

1. **Load enriched JSON files** containing entities and attribute embeddings.
2. **Build a FAISS vector index** from these embeddings for similarity search.
3. **Set up an OpenAI LLM with LangChain’s RetrievalQA** chain to answer queries using retrieved context.
4. **Process each query**: retrieve the top matching attribute, generate an answer, and record the results (including scores and metadata) in a pandas DataFrame.

Below is the complete Python script with detailed comments explaining each step:

# Print or save the DataFrame as needed

```

In this script, we first load all JSON records and gather each attribute’s text and embedding. We then build a **FAISS** index from these embeddings using LangChain’s convenience method (avoiding any re-embedding). FAISS enables efficient similarity search even for large vector sets. Next, we set up a **retriever** on this vector store and integrate it with an **OpenAI GPT-3.5/GPT-4** model in a LangChain `RetrievalQA` chain. For each query, the retriever finds the most relevant attribute(s) (with a similarity score), and the LLM generates an answer using the attribute definitions as context. Finally, results are collected into a pandas DataFrame with columns for the query, the generated answer, the top-matching attribute and its entity/table, and a relevance score. This approach ensures the LLM’s answers are grounded in the data from the JSON files, fulfilling the retrieval-augmented generation objective.
