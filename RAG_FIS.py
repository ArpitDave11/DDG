Perfect. I’ll now prepare a complete FAISS + LangChain (langchain-community) notebook that:

* Loads a JSON file containing attributes and their precomputed OpenAI embeddings (text-embedding-ada-002)
* Creates a FAISS vector store and persists it to disk
* Reloads the FAISS index on demand
* Converts the index into a retriever
* Uses LangChain's RetrievalQA with OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo
* Takes a pandas DataFrame with a column called `schemas_name`, performs semantic lookup using the retriever, and generates a new column `ai_generate` with the AI-generated description for each row

I’ll let you know as soon as the notebook is ready.


# Databricks Notebook: FAISS Vector Indexing and Retrieval QA with LangChain

In this notebook, we demonstrate how to build and use a FAISS vector index for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using LangChain. We leverage precomputed text embeddings (1536-dimensional vectors from OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model) for our knowledge base, store them in a FAISS index, and use OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo to generate descriptions for given schema names. The workflow includes installing the necessary packages, loading embeddings from JSON, building/saving a FAISS index, reloading it, wrapping it with a retriever, and using a RetrievalQA chain to populate a pandas DataFrame with AI-generated descriptions.

## Setup: Install and Import Dependencies

First, install the required libraries. LangChain’s FAISS integration resides in the `langchain-community` package (with a version compatible with LangChain 0.3.25) and requires the `faiss-cpu` library. We also install `langchain-openai` for OpenAI model support (since OpenAI integrations were split into a separate package). In Databricks, you can use `%pip install` to add these to your environment. After installation, we import necessary classes and set up the OpenAI API key for GPT-3.5 Turbo (for generation):

```python
# Install LangChain 0.3.25 and related integrations
%pip install langchain==0.3.25 langchain-community faiss-cpu langchain-openai

# After installing, import the required modules
import faiss
from uuid import uuid4
import json
import pandas as pd

# LangChain core and integration classes
from langchain_core.documents import Document
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_community.docstore.in_memory import InMemoryDocstore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings, ChatOpenAI

# Set up OpenAI API key (ensure this is configured with your key or Databricks secret)
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY>"
```

**Note:** The OpenAI API key is required for embedding queries and generating answers. In practice, you should store this securely (e.g., using Databricks Secrets) rather than hard-coding it. The code above uses environment variable for simplicity.

## Load Precomputed Embeddings from JSON

Assume we have a JSON file (e.g., `embeddings.json`) containing our knowledge base: a list of entities with their attributes, where each attribute has a text description and a precomputed 1536-dimension embedding vector (from the Ada-002 model). We will load this JSON file and prepare the data for indexing. We create `Document` objects for each attribute (storing the text and any relevant metadata like entity name), and collect all embedding vectors into a list:

```python
# Path to the JSON file containing entities and attribute embeddings (stored on DBFS for example)
json_path = "/dbfs/FileStore/embeddings.json"

# Load the JSON data
with open(json_path, 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Prepare documents and embeddings list
documents = []
embeddings_list = []
for item in data:
    # Each `item` is expected to have 'text' (attribute description) and 'embedding' (1536-dim vector)
    text = item.get('text') or item.get('attribute_text')  # adjust key as needed
    embedding = item['embedding']
    # Optional: include entity/attribute metadata if present in JSON
    metadata = {}
    if 'entity' in item:
        metadata['entity'] = item['entity']
    if 'attribute' in item:
        metadata['attribute'] = item['attribute']
    # Create a Document for this attribute
    documents.append(Document(page_content=text, metadata=metadata))
    embeddings_list.append(embedding)

# Verify we have the same number of documents and embedding vectors
print(f"Loaded {len(documents)} documents with {len(embeddings_list)} corresponding embeddings.")
```

Here we assume each JSON record provides a text content for the attribute (e.g. a description or definition) and a precomputed embedding vector. We preserve any entity or attribute names as metadata in the Document. The `embeddings_list` will be used to populate the FAISS index. Each embedding should be a list or array of 1536 float values.

## Build and Save the FAISS Vector Index

Next, we construct a FAISS index and wrap it in LangChain’s `FAISS` vector store. We use a Flat L2 index (which performs brute-force similarity search in memory) with dimension 1536. We then add all embedding vectors to this index. Alongside the index, LangChain uses an in-memory docstore to hold the actual `Document` objects and a mapping from FAISS vector IDs to docstore IDs. We generate unique IDs for each document using UUIDs and build the mappings accordingly. Finally, we save the index (and accompanying data) to disk so it can be reused without rebuilding each time:

```python
# Initialize FAISS index for 1536-dim embeddings
dimension = len(embeddings_list[0])
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)

# Add all embeddings to the index (convert to float32 NumPy array)
index.add(np.array(embeddings_list, dtype='float32'))

# Prepare the docstore and id mappings
ids = [str(uuid4()) for _ in documents]          # unique IDs for each document
docstore = InMemoryDocstore({uid: doc for uid, doc in zip(ids, documents)})
index_to_id = {i: uid for i, uid in enumerate(ids)}

# Create the LangChain FAISS vector store with the index, docstore, and mapping
embedding_model = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-ada-002")  # embedding model for queries
vector_store = FAISS(
    embedding_function=embedding_model,
    index=index,
    docstore=docstore,
    index_to_docstore_id=index_to_id
)

# Save the FAISS index (this will create files under the given path)
vector_store.save_local("/dbfs/FileStore/faiss_index")
print(f"FAISS index built with {vector_store.index.ntotal} vectors and saved to disk.")
```

We used `faiss.IndexFlatL2` for simplicity, which is an exact similarity search (sufficient for moderate dataset sizes). Each document was assigned a UUID and added to the `InMemoryDocstore`. We then instantiated `FAISS` with our pre-filled index, docstore, and ID mapping. LangChain’s `FAISS` wrapper will use the provided `embedding_function` (OpenAI's Ada model in our case) to embed query strings at query time. We save the index to `/dbfs/FileStore/faiss_index` – on Databricks, this path is persisted (DBFS).

**Note:** The `FAISS.save_local` method writes out the FAISS index and pickled metadata so that it can be reloaded later without recomputing. Now that the index is saved, we can load it in future sessions or on other cluster workers as needed.

## Reload the FAISS Index from Disk

To simulate using the index in a new session (or after cluster restarts), we can load the saved index from disk. LangChain provides `FAISS.load_local`, which reconstructs the vector store given the save directory, an embeddings object, and a flag to allow loading of pickled data. We must supply the same embedding function that was originally used (so that queries will be embedded consistently). We also enable `allow_dangerous_deserialization=True` because loading the stored index involves unpickling the metadata (LangChain requires this explicit flag as a safety measure):

```python
# Reinitialize the embedding model (ensure it matches the one used for the vectors)
embedding_model = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-ada-002")

# Load the FAISS vector store from disk
new_vector_store = FAISS.load_local(
    "/dbfs/FileStore/faiss_index",
    embeddings=embedding_model,
    allow_dangerous_deserialization=True
)
print(f"Reloaded FAISS index with {new_vector_store.index.ntotal} vectors.")
```

After loading, `new_vector_store` is an equivalent `FAISS` vector store containing our documents and ready for similarity search. At this point, we have a persistent vector index that we can query. All similarity searches will be handled by FAISS, using our precomputed embeddings, and will return the stored `Document` objects.

## Create a Retriever and the RetrievalQA Chain

With the vector store ready, we wrap it in a retriever interface and initialize a RetrievalQA chain using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo as the LLM. The retriever is obtained via `vector_store.as_retriever()`, which returns a LangChain retriever object (by default, it will use similarity search on the vector store with k=4 or you can specify `search_kwargs={"k": K}` for a different number of results). For the LLM, we use `ChatOpenAI` from `langchain_openai` to access GPT-3.5. We then create a RetrievalQA chain that will use the retriever to fetch relevant documents and the chat model to generate an answer:

```python
# Create a retriever from the vector store (default k=4 neighbors; adjust as needed)
retriever = new_vector_store.as_retriever()

# Initialize the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo model (chat model) for generation
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)  # temperature=0 for deterministic output

# Create the RetrievalQA chain using the LLM and the retriever
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=retriever,
    chain_type="stuff"  # "stuff" method: directly stuff retrieved docs into prompt
)
```

The `RetrievalQA` chain will take a query, use the retriever to do a similarity search in our FAISS index, and pass the resulting documents (as context) to the GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The model will then produce an answer (in our case, a description of the schema) based on that context. We set `temperature=0` for the LLM to reduce randomness and get more consistent results.

*(LangChain’s `RetrievalQA` is a high-level chain that simplifies retrieval-augmented Q\&A. Under the hood, it’s equivalent to creating a prompt that injects retrieved documents and asking the LLM to answer. In LangChain v0.3.25, `RetrievalQA.from_chain_type` is a convenient way to set this up. Note that more recent versions might use `create_retrieval_chain`, but `RetrievalQA` remains available for now.)*

## Generate AI-Based Descriptions for Each Schema

Finally, we load our pandas DataFrame that contains a column `schemas_name` for which we want to generate descriptions. For each row in this DataFrame, we will use the retrieval QA chain to get an AI-generated description and append it as a new column `ai_generate`. We can simply loop over the DataFrame rows and call `qa_chain.run()` with the schema name as the query. The chain will retrieve relevant info from the FAISS index and produce a description using GPT-3.5:

```python
# Example: Load the DataFrame of schema names (replace with actual data source or Spark conversion as needed)
df = pd.read_csv("/dbfs/FileStore/schemas.csv")  # contains a column 'schemas_name'

# For each schema, query the chain to get a description
descriptions = []
for name in df['schemas_name']:
    query = f"Describe the '{name}' schema."  # formulate a query for the schema name
    result = qa_chain.run(query)
    descriptions.append(result)

# Append the results as a new column in the DataFrame
df['ai_generate'] = descriptions

# Display a few examples
print(df[['schemas_name', 'ai_generate']].head(5).to_string(index=False))
```

In the above code, we construct a simple prompt (`"Describe the '<name>' schema."`) using each schema name. This query is passed to the RetrievalQA chain, which returns a description generated by the LLM. We collect all results and add them to the DataFrame under `ai_generate`. At the end, each row in `df` will have the original `schemas_name` and a corresponding AI-generated description.

**Note:** Iterating with `iterrows()` or a Python loop is straightforward but may be slow if you have many schemas (as it calls the LLM for each row). If performance is a concern, you could vectorize this with Pandas `apply` or use asynchronous calls to the chain. In this example, we assume the number of schemas is manageable. Also, ensure that your OpenAI API usage is within allowable limits, as this will send one request per schema.

## Conclusion

We have built a Databricks-compatible workflow for generating schema descriptions using a FAISS vector store and LangChain. The steps included loading precomputed Ada embeddings, indexing them with FAISS, and using LangChain’s retriever and `RetrievalQA` chain with GPT-3.5 Turbo to produce natural language descriptions. All similarity searches are handled locally by FAISS (using our stored embeddings), and the generation of the description is done by OpenAI’s model via LangChain. By saving the FAISS index to disk, we ensure the index can be reused efficiently across sessions without recomputation. This approach showcases how to implement retrieval-augmented generation in a production environment like Databricks, combining efficient vector search with powerful language models.
