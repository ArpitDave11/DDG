Yes, 100% we can tweak this idea to visualize GitLab Epics (parent/child) → full diagram instead of generic text prompts. That’s actually a super clean use case.

Let me show you how it changes the design, and then I’ll give you 2–3 modified prompts tailored for the GitLab-epic version.

How the idea changes for GitLab epics

Instead of:

user types free text → agents invent content → diagram

We do:

GitLab project/group → fetch epics/issues via API → agents structure & explain → diagram

New high-level flow

Data layer (GitLab API)

You give:

GitLab group ID / project ID / epic ID

Personal Access Token (PAT)

Backend (Python) calls:

/groups/:id/epics or /projects/:id/issues etc.

Build a structure like:

{
  "epic_id": 123,
  "title": "Main Platform Rewrite",
  "children": [
    { "epic_id": 124, "title": "Backend", "children": [...] },
    { "epic_id": 130, "title": "Frontend", "children": [...] }
  ]
}


Agent pipeline (simplified roles)
You might not even need 4 agents now. Example:

Structure Agent

Takes raw GitLab JSON and produces a clean tree/graph model with fields like id, title, status, weight, progress.

Diagram Agent

Converts that tree into Mermaid (or another diagram spec) e.g.:

hierarchy view (parent → child)

status color coding (Open / In Progress / Closed)

Summary Agent (optional)

Generates a short text summary of the epic tree: “This epic has 4 child epics, 12 issues, 70% closed…”

Visualization layer

Use Mermaid for:

mindmap (epic → child epics → issues)

or graph TD tree with links and labels.

Frontend renders:

Diagram of epics

Side panel with summary, counts, etc.

What changes in the stack?

From the previous design, you mainly add:

A small gitlab_client.py:

Uses requests or httpx

Reads GITLAB_BASE_URL + GITLAB_TOKEN from .env

A new endpoint:

GET /api/epic-visual/:epic_id
or

GET /api/group-visual/:group_id

The rest (Azure OpenAI, FastAPI, Mermaid frontend, VS Code) stays the same.

3 Modified Prompts (GitLab-epic flavor)

You can reuse the earlier 10 prompts but here are three key ones rewritten specifically for GitLab epic visualisation.

Prompt A – Design GitLab-specific Architecture

You are a senior software architect.
I want to build a VS-Code-first app that:

Connects to GitLab using a Personal Access Token (PAT).

Fetches epics and their parent/child relationships for a given group, project, or epic ID.

Converts that structure into a visual diagram (Mermaid or similar) using Azure OpenAI agents.
Please propose:

A folder structure for a Python + FastAPI backend (gitlab_client.py, agents.py, pipeline.py, main.py, etc.).

Which GitLab APIs to call (conceptually – I’ll fill in URLs and params).

The core data model for an EpicNode tree (id, title, status, children, etc.).

Prompt B – Define Agents for Epic → Diagram

You are an LLM agent designer.
I’m building a GitLab epic visualizer. I already fetch a nested JSON of epics and issues with parent/child relationships.
I want 2–3 agents using Azure OpenAI:

Structure Agent – cleans and normalizes the epic tree.

Diagram Agent – converts the epic tree into Mermaid syntax (mindmap or graph) including status and assignee in node labels.

Summary Agent (optional) – produces a brief textual overview of the epic hierarchy.
For each agent, please give:

Role/system prompt

Expected input JSON schema

Expected output JSON schema

One example input and output.

Prompt C – Build the Epic Visual Pipeline

You are a Python backend engineer.
Write a pipeline.py module that:

Has a function build_epic_diagram(epic_tree: EpicNode) -> DiagramResult

Internally calls the Structure Agent → Diagram Agent → Summary Agent (if defined).

Returns a DiagramResult containing:

Diagram type (e.g. "gitlab_epic_tree")

Mermaid code string

Summary text
Use Pydantic models for EpicNode and DiagramResult.
Assume Azure OpenAI client is already set up and imported as azure_client.
Provide complete code for pipeline.py.

To keep us moving and in “study mode”:

👉 Quick check for you:
How exactly do you imagine the final diagram to look for a single epic?

Like a tree (root epic → child epics → issues)?

Or like a flow (Idea → Epic → Tasks → Done)?

Describe one concrete example (even rough text is fine), and then I can help you turn that into the exact Mermaid format + agent behavior.
