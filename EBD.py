Perfect. I’ll prepare a Python script that processes all JSON files in a folder, generates embeddings for each attribute or small group of related attributes using OpenAI’s `text-embedding-3-small` model, and stores the results in two formats:

1. An enriched JSON file (original structure with embedding vectors added per attribute).
2. A flattened CSV file containing one row per attribute, with metadata and embedding.

Additionally, I’ll include guidance on how to structure this data effectively for use in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, including format tips for chunking, indexing, and storing embeddings in a vector store.

I’ll let you know once the script is ready.


# JSON Attribute Embedding Script and RAG Integration

## Required Libraries

* **OpenAI Python Client (`openai`)** – for calling the OpenAI Embeddings API
* **Tenacity (`tenacity`)** – for implementing exponential backoff retries on API calls
* Built-in libraries: **os**, **json**, **csv** (for file operations and data handling)

## Python Script Implementation

Below is a standalone Python script that processes all JSON files in a specified input folder. For each JSON file, it adds an embedding vector to each attribute and produces a CSV with all attributes' information. The script uses OpenAI’s `text-embedding-3-small` model for embeddings and employs **tenacity** to handle rate limit errors with exponential backoff. Inline comments are included for clarity.

```python
import os
import json
import csv
import openai
from tenacity import retry, wait_random_exponential, stop_after_attempt

# === Configuration ===
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY", "<YOUR-OPENAI-API-KEY>")  # Set your API key
input_folder = "path/to/json/folder"      # Folder containing input JSON files
output_folder = "path/to/output/folder"   # Folder to save output JSON files with embeddings
csv_output_path = "embeddings_output.csv" # Path for the combined CSV output

# Ensure the output folder exists
os.makedirs(output_folder, exist_ok=True)

# Prepare the CSV output file and write the header row
csv_file = open(csv_output_path, mode='w', newline='', encoding='utf-8')
csv_writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
csv_writer.writerow([
    "model_name", "entity_name", "table_name", 
    "attribute_name", "column_name", "column_data_type", "pk", "embedding"
])

# Define a retryable function to get embeddings with exponential backoff
@retry(wait=wait_random_exponential(min=1, max=60), stop=stop_after_attempt(6))
def get_embedding(text, model="text-embedding-3-small"):
    """Call OpenAI Embedding API to get the embedding vector for given text."""
    response = openai.Embedding.create(input=text, model=model)
    embedding_vector = response['data'][0]['embedding']  # 1536-dim embedding vector
    return embedding_vector

# Loop through each JSON file in the input folder
for filename in os.listdir(input_folder):
    if not filename.endswith(".json"):
        continue  # skip non-JSON files
    file_path = os.path.join(input_folder, filename)
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    # Extract high-level info for context
    model_name = data.get("Model", "")
    entity_info = data.get("Entity", {})
    table_name = entity_info.get("TABLE_NAME", "")
    entity_name = entity_info.get("ENTITY NAME", "")

    # Iterate over each attribute in the JSON
    for attr in data.get("Attributes", []):
        attr_name = attr.get("NAME", "")
        attr_def  = attr.get("DEFINITION", "")
        column_name = attr.get("Column Name", "")
        col_type   = attr.get("Column Data Type", "")
        pk_flag    = attr.get("PK?", "")

        # Determine the text to embed: use definition if available, otherwise fall back to the attribute name
        text_to_embed = attr_def if attr_def and attr_def != "No definition available" else attr_name
        if not text_to_embed or text_to_embed.strip() == "":
            text_to_embed = attr_name  # ensure there's some text to embed

        # Generate the embedding vector for the text (with retry on rate limits)
        try:
            embedding_vector = get_embedding(text_to_embed)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Warning: Failed to get embedding for attribute '{attr_name}' ({e}). Skipping.")
            continue

        # Add embedding vector to the JSON data structure
        attr["embedding"] = embedding_vector

        # Write a row to the CSV with all relevant fields (embedding stored as JSON string)
        embedding_str = json.dumps(embedding_vector)
        csv_writer.writerow([
            model_name, entity_name, table_name, 
            attr_name, column_name, col_type, pk_flag, embedding_str
        ])

    # Save the modified JSON (with embeddings) to the output folder
    output_path = os.path.join(output_folder, filename)
    with open(output_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as out_f:
        json.dump(data, out_f, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)

# Close the CSV file
csv_file.close()
```

**How it works:** The script loads each JSON file, then for each attribute it prepares a text prompt (using the attribute’s definition if available, otherwise the name). It calls the OpenAI embeddings endpoint to get a **1536-dimensional** vector representation for the text (OpenAI’s `text-embedding-3-small` model produces 1536-length embeddings). The `tenacity.retry` decorator is used to automatically retry the API call with exponential backoff in case a rate limit (`RateLimitError`) is encountered, waiting a random interval between 1 and 60 seconds between attempts. Each attribute’s embedding is added into the JSON data under a new `"embedding"` field, and a row is appended to the CSV file with the attribute’s metadata and embedding (the vector is serialized as a JSON string in one CSV column). After processing all attributes, the enriched JSON is saved to the output folder (preserving the original structure and adding embeddings), and a consolidated CSV (`embeddings_output.csv`) contains one row per attribute across all files.

## Using the Enriched Data in RAG Pipelines

Once you have the JSON files augmented with embeddings and the aggregated CSV, you can integrate this data into a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline. Below are key considerations for chunking, metadata, and indexing:

* **Chunking Strategy:** In a RAG workflow, each attribute (or a logically grouped set of attributes) can serve as a *document chunk* for retrieval. The JSON structure already breaks content down by attribute, which is a fine-grained chunk size. Chunking data into small, semantically coherent pieces is crucial because LLMs have context length limits. In general, smaller chunks (e.g. a single attribute’s definition) improve retrieval precision, while larger chunks provide more context. If an attribute’s definition is extremely short or missing, consider grouping it with related attributes or including the entity’s overall definition to form a more meaningful chunk. The goal is to maintain **semantic integrity** of each chunk so that when a user’s query is vectorized, it can accurately match relevant pieces of knowledge without losing context.

* **Metadata Structure:** Storing rich metadata alongside each embedding enables more powerful retrieval and filtering. In this case, each embedding can be tagged with fields like **model name**, **entity name**, **table name**, **attribute name**, etc. (all the columns from the CSV). This metadata can be stored in a vector database or search index so that you can later filter or understand results (for example, you could filter to a specific model or table if needed, or simply use metadata to display the source of retrieved information). By enhancing embeddings with such metadata, you ensure more efficient and accurate retrieval. The JSON files themselves retain a hierarchical metadata structure (entity-level and attribute-level), whereas the CSV gives a flat view — both can be used to reload metadata when inserting into a vector store.

* **Embedding Indexing and Retrieval:** Load the embedding vectors into a vector search index optimized for similarity search (you can use libraries or services like **FAISS**, **Pinecone**, **Milvus**, or **pgvector**). Each embedding (1536-dimensional from `text-embedding-3-small`) should be indexed along with its metadata. Vector databases are designed to handle high-dimensional embeddings and support fast approximate nearest-neighbor searches. For example, you might create a collection in a vector DB where each entry consists of the embedding plus metadata (`model_name`, `entity_name`, etc.). When implementing the RAG pipeline, the process would be:

  1. **Indexing** – Insert all attribute embeddings into the vector store with their metadata (this is informed by the CSV/JSON output). This is the pre-processing step (often called *embedding indexing*), which prepares the knowledge base for retrieval.
  2. **Retrieval** – For an incoming query, compute its embedding using the same model, then query the vector store for the nearest embeddings. The result will be the most semantically similar attribute definitions or groups, which you can retrieve along with their metadata.
  3. **Augmentation** – Take the retrieved pieces of text (e.g. attribute definitions) and include them as context in your LLM prompt. The metadata can help format the context (e.g. indicating which entity/table an attribute belongs to).
  4. **Generation** – The LLM, now augmented with relevant context, can answer the user’s query using both its internal knowledge and the provided data.

By following this approach, your RAG system will be able to pull in definitions of entities and attributes on the fly to answer questions. The chunking strategy ensures each retrieved piece is digestible by the model, metadata provides traceability and filterability, and proper embedding indexing in a vector database enables fast and accurate similarity search across your enterprise data. This combination lays a strong foundation for a robust RAG pipeline, empowering the LLM to generate informed responses grounded in your JSON-defined data.
