## Project Overview


### Technological Framework
We Will integrate the below tech stack 
- **Azure OpenAI Service:** for deploying both baseline and fine-tuned GPT‑4 models (if needed).
- **Jsonal:** Serves as Metadata of JSON.
- **Similarity Search:** Empowers rapid retrieval of semantically similar historical examples.
- **PostgreSQL:** Database.

## Development Roadmap


### Phase 1: Architectural Design and System Modeling
- **Component Segmentation:**
  - **Data Ingestion Module:** Responsible for extracting metadata or converting existing data in JSONL from Azure Blob Storage.
  - **Retrieval Mechanism:** Leverages historical examples to inform and enhance the generation process.
  - **Generation Engine:** Use the existing GPT‑4 model, which may be applied either in its baseline state or after fine-tuning based on accuracy of descriptions.
  - **Data Persistence Layer:** Integrates with PostgreSQL for the reliable storage of generated descriptions-- do not upsert intially but create a new replica and verify .
  - **API Interface Layer:** We can use a RESTful API using FastAPI for real-time interactions or if we have any other interface then we can leverage the existing one.


### Phase 2: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
- **Metadata Compilation:** Collate metadata files (JSON) into a centralized repository.
- **Data Cleansing:** Undertake rigorous data validation to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- **Historical Data Aggregation:** Assemble a corpus of prompt-response pairs to serve as a foundation for model fine tuning.

### Phase 3: Implementation of the Retrieval Component
- **Embedding Computation:** Convert historical textual examples into high-dimensional embeddings using the OpenAI embedding API.
- **Index Construction:** build an efficient similarity index, thereby enhancing the retrieval of contextually relevant examples.
- **Performance Verification:** Rigorously test the retrieval component to ensure semantic relevance and retrieval accuracy.

### Phase 4: Development of the Description Generation Pipeline
- **Contextual Integration:** Synthesize system instructions with retrieved examples to generate coherent and contextually appropriate descriptions.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Employ iterative testing and expert feedback to optimize the quality and consistency of the generated outputs.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** monitor quantitative metrics for assessing the performance of the generation engine.

### Phase 5: Database Integration and API Deployment
- **Data Integration Strategy:** Develop robust mechanisms to upsert generated descriptions into PostgreSQL, ensuring transactional integrity.
- **API Development:** Construct a RESTful API employing FastAPI to provide real-time access to the generation service.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Prepare detailed documentation, including API endpoints, error handling protocols, and usage scenarios.
- **System Testing:** Execute comprehensive tests (unit, integration, and system-level) to validate end-to-end functionality.

### Phase 6: Fine Tuning and Continuous Improvement
- **Model Fine Tuning:** Execute fine-tuning procedures using the historical dataset to enhance model precision and context-awareness.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Continuously assess model performance in production, instituting feedback loops to drive iterative improvements.
- **Future Enhancements:** Explore avenues for further system enhancements, such as multilingual support or integration with additional data sources.

## Cost Analysis: Baseline Model vs. Fine-Tuned Model

### Baseline Model Approach (Without Fine Tuning)
- **Methodology:**  
  The system employs the off-the-shelf GPT‑4 model as provided by Azure OpenAI.
- **Advantages:**
  - **Reduced Initial Expenditure:** Minimal upfront costs due to the absence of additional training overhead.
  - **Rapid Implementation:** Facilitates immediate deployment and operationalization.
- **Limitations:**
  - **Generic Descriptions:** Outputs may exhibit a degree of genericness, necessitating subsequent manual revisions.
  - **Increased Post-Processing:** Higher likelihood of additional manual intervention to align the outputs with domain-specific requirements.

### Fine-Tuned Model Approach (Custom Model)
- **Methodology:**  
  The model is refined through fine-tuning using a domain-specific corpus, resulting in highly tailored and accurate descriptions.
- **Advantages:**
  - **Enhanced Precision:** Fine tuning engenders outputs that are more contextually relevant and accurate, reducing the need for human intervention.
  - **Long-Term Efficiency:** Although the initial costs are higher, long-term benefits include reduced error rates and decreased manual adjustments.
- **Limitations:**
  - **Upfront Investment:** Requires significant initial investment, both in terms of computational resources and financial outlay. For instance, training 1 GB (approximately 250 million tokens) can incur a cost in the vicinity of ~$7,500 (subject to actual pricing variability).
  - **Resource Intensive:** Demands substantial time and resource commitment for effective fine tuning and subsequent monitoring.

### Comparative Summary
- **Economic Considerations:**  
  The baseline model offers a cost-effective and rapid deployment solution ideal for constrained budgets. Conversely, fine tuning represents an investment in quality and operational efficiency, potentially yielding long-term cost savings through improved output accuracy and reduced manual processing.
- **Strategic Implications:**  
  The decision between the two approaches should be informed by the specific operational requirements, budgetary constraints, and the criticality of high-precision attribute descriptions in the overall data management strategy.
