Great, I’ll prepare a Databricks-compatible PySpark script that:

* Reads specified Parquet files \[A.parquet, B.parquet, C.parquet, D.parquet] from `/mnt/data`.
* Uses the corresponding COBOL copybooks (flat file format, EBCDIC code page `cp037_extended`) from `/mnt/copybook` (with `_cp.copybook` suffix) to extract schema.
* Builds a PostgreSQL `CREATE TABLE` DDL for each file using the copybook schema, inferring primary keys based on naming heuristics.
* Loads each DataFrame into PostgreSQL, with support for both overwrite and append modes.
* Creates optimal indexes (including B-tree and composite indexes) to ensure high performance for banking analytics.

I’ll get started and update you shortly with the complete code.


# Databricks PySpark Script for COBOL Copybook Parquet Ingestion to PostgreSQL

## Overview

This script reads Parquet files (`A.parquet`, `B.parquet`, `C.parquet`, `D.parquet`) from an Azure Databricks mount (`/mnt/data`), uses corresponding COBOL copybooks (`/mnt/copybook/A_cp.copybook`, etc.) to determine the schema, and loads the data into PostgreSQL with the proper table schema, primary keys, and indexes. The COBOL copybooks (encoded in EBCDIC code page **cp037**) are parsed to extract field names and types, which are mapped to PostgreSQL data types. The script infers primary keys based on naming conventions (e.g. an `"id"` column or `<table>_id` fields) and generates a **CREATE TABLE** DDL with those keys. It then loads the Parquet data into a Spark DataFrame and writes to PostgreSQL via JDBC. We support both **overwrite** (drop/recreate table) and **append** modes. Finally, the script creates **B-tree indexes** on ID and date/time columns (common in banking analytics) and composite indexes where appropriate for typical query patterns. Robust logging and error handling are included to ensure production-quality reliability.

**Prerequisites:** Ensure the Azure storage is mounted to `/mnt/data` and `/mnt/copybook`. Also, the PostgreSQL JDBC driver must be available to Spark (e.g., by attaching the `org.postgresql.Driver` JAR to the cluster or using `--packages`). PostgreSQL connection details are represented with placeholders and should be configured (e.g., via Databricks secrets or environment variables). The Python library **psycopg2** is used for executing DDL and index creation statements on PostgreSQL – install it in your environment if not already present.

## Reading COBOL Copybooks and Mapping to PostgreSQL Schema

Each COBOL copybook is read in text mode with the **cp037** codec to properly decode EBCDIC characters into Unicode. The copybook describes the record layout with COBOL PIC clauses. We parse these to obtain field names and data types:

* **Alphanumeric fields:** `PIC X(n)` (or `PIC A(n)`) are treated as strings. We map these to `VARCHAR(n)` in PostgreSQL (or `TEXT` for very large n), since `PIC X(100)` denotes a 100-byte string in COBOL.
* **Numeric fields:** `PIC 9(...)` definitions can include an `S` for sign and `V` for an implied decimal point. For example, `PIC S9(7)V99` means a signed number with 7 integer digits and 2 decimal digits. We map these to appropriate numeric SQL types:

  * If an implicit decimal is present (V notation), we use a **DECIMAL(p,s)** in PostgreSQL with precision *p* and scale *s* corresponding to the total digits and decimal places. For instance, `PIC S9(7)V99` becomes `DECIMAL(9,2)` (9 total digits, 2 after the decimal).
  * If no V (integer value) and no special usage, we infer an integer type. We leverage COBOL storage usage to decide size: a display or binary integer with up to 4 digits is mapped to `SMALLINT`, up to 9 digits to `INTEGER`, and up to 18 digits to `BIGINT`. This follows typical COBOL/SQL mappings (e.g. `PIC S9(4) COMP-5` → SQL SMALLINT, `PIC S9(9) COMP-5` → SQL INTEGER). Larger integers (over 18 digits) default to `DECIMAL(p,0)` for full precision.
  * **Packed decimal (COMP-3):** These fields are binary-coded decimals often used for currency and fixed-point arithmetic in COBOL. We map COMP-3 to PostgreSQL DECIMAL/NUMERIC as well. The precision is the total number of 9's, and scale is the number of digits after V if any. For example, `PIC 9(5)V99 COMP-3` becomes `DECIMAL(7,2)`. If a COMP-3 has no decimal places (scale 0), it’s an integer value; we still use `NUMERIC` by default, but if it has 18 digits we may treat it as BIGINT (since 18-digit packed fits in 64-bit).
  * **Binary computational (COMP/COMP-5):** These are native binary integers. We use the same digit thresholds as above (e.g. 1–4 digits → SMALLINT, 5–9 → INTEGER, 10–18 → BIGINT). This ensures efficient storage for integer counters etc.
  * **Floating-point:** If the copybook uses `COMP-1` (single precision) or `COMP-2` (double precision) for floating-point numbers, we map those to `REAL` and `DOUBLE PRECISION` in PostgreSQL, respectively.
* **Field name normalization:** COBOL field names may contain hyphens (e.g. `ACCOUNT-NUMBER`). We convert these to lowercase with underscores (e.g. `account_number`) to form valid SQL identifiers and to follow SQL naming conventions. We ignore COBOL filler or redefines lines, focusing only on actual data fields.

Using the above rules, the script programmatically constructs a list of `(column_name, sql_data_type)` for each field in the copybook. This gives us the schema definition for the PostgreSQL table. For example, a copybook field defined as `05 CUSTOMER-NAME PIC X(30).` would result in `customer_name VARCHAR(30)` in the DDL, while `05 ACCOUNT-BALANCE PIC S9(7)V99 COMP-3.` would become a DECIMAL(9,2) column `account_balance DECIMAL(9,2)`. These mappings align with standard COBOL-SQL data type conversions.

## Inferring Primary Keys from Naming Conventions

We infer primary key columns using simple naming heuristics common in database design. If a field is named exactly `"id"`, we take that as the primary key. Otherwise, if a field matches the table name plus “\_id” (for example, a **Customer** table might have `customer_id`), we treat that as the primary key. In many conventions, the primary key of a table is either an `id` column or a composite of the entity name with `_id`. If multiple fields end in “\_id” and no single one appears to be the table’s own identifier, the script will assume a composite primary key composed of **all** those “\_id” fields. (This could be the case for an associative table or a table with a multi-column natural key.) These are just heuristics – they can be refined as needed – but they cover typical cases. For instance, if the `A.parquet` data corresponds to an Accounts table and has fields `account_id` and `customer_id`, the script would infer `account_id` as the primary key (assuming the table is “account”). If the table were a junction (e.g. linking customers and products with `customer_id` and `product_id` and no singular id field), both would be taken as a composite primary key.

## Generating PostgreSQL DDL Statements

With the column definitions and inferred primary key, the script constructs a **CREATE TABLE** DDL string for each dataset. Each column is listed with its name and PostgreSQL type. If primary key column(s) were identified, a `PRIMARY KEY (...)` clause is added to the DDL. For example, if processing `A.parquet` yields columns `account_id BIGINT, customer_id BIGINT, balance DECIMAL(9,2)`, and `account_id` is the primary key, the generated DDL would look like:

```sql
CREATE TABLE account (
    account_id BIGINT,
    customer_id BIGINT,
    balance DECIMAL(9,2),
    PRIMARY KEY (account_id)
);
```

If multiple primary key columns are inferred, they are all listed in the PRIMARY KEY clause (e.g. `PRIMARY KEY (customer_id, product_id)`). The table name is derived from the file (we use the base name like “A” -> table `a` by default, adjusting case to lowercase). The script uses **IF NOT EXISTS** when creating tables in append mode, so it won’t error out if the table already exists. In overwrite mode, it will drop the table first (with `CASCADE` to avoid foreign key issues) before re-creating it. All DDL execution is logged for transparency.

## Loading Parquet Data into PostgreSQL via Spark

After defining the table schema, the script reads each Parquet file into a Spark DataFrame and writes it to the PostgreSQL database using JDBC. We use PySpark’s DataFrameWriter with the **jdbc** format to stream the data into the database. The JDBC connection URL, table name, and credentials are specified via options. For example, we use a URL of the form `jdbc:postgresql://<HOST>:<PORT>/<DB>` with a placeholder driver name `org.postgresql.Driver`. The script uses placeholders for the actual connection parameters (host, port, database, user, password) – these should be filled in or configured securely (e.g., via Databricks secrets). An example write call in the script looks like:

```python
df.write \
    .format("jdbc") \
    .option("url", jdbc_url) \
    .option("dbtable", target_table) \
    .option("user", db_user) \
    .option("password", db_password) \
    .option("driver", jdbc_driver) \
    .mode("append") \
    .save()
```

This instructs Spark to connect and load the DataFrame into the specified PostgreSQL table. We choose the write **mode** based on user input: for an overwrite operation, the script will (after creating the table) write in append mode to avoid Spark dropping the table schema. In append mode, it simply inserts the new data. The script handles overwrite by explicitly dropping and re-creating the table (via our DDL) before writing, ensuring the schema (including primary keys) is as expected, since Spark’s default overwrite might not recreate constraints. For append mode, if the table doesn’t exist, we create it first (using `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`) so that the DataFrame write will succeed.

**Note:** It’s assumed the Parquet schema matches the copybook schema (e.g., fields order and types correspond), since the Parquet files likely came from the same source. The Spark write operation may internally batch records, so proper JDBC driver and network configuration (batch size, etc.) might be tuned for large volumes. In this script, we use default settings for simplicity. Progress and any issues during the write are logged.

## Creating Indexes for Analytics Workloads

Once the data is loaded, the script creates additional indexes to optimize common query patterns in banking analytics. We focus on:

* **Primary key indexes:** PostgreSQL automatically creates a unique index on primary key columns, so if there is a single primary key (e.g., `account_id`), it’s already indexed as a byproduct of the PRIMARY KEY constraint. In cases of composite primary keys, Postgres creates a composite index on those columns together. However, the script will still ensure that any `_id` columns get standalone indexes as well, because a composite PK index (say on `(customer_id, product_id)`) does not by itself speed up a query filtering by only `customer_id` or only `product_id`. We create a B-tree index on each individual ID field that is likely to be used for lookups or joins. (We skip creating a duplicate index for a single-column primary key to avoid redundancy, since that index already exists.) B-tree indexes are the default in Postgres and are well-suited for equality and range queries on numeric or text data – they will be used for lookups by ID or date range in most cases.
* **Date/Timestamp indexes:** Many banking queries filter or sort on date/time columns (e.g., transaction date). The script automatically creates indexes on any column whose name suggests a date or time (e.g., ends with "\_date", "\_time") or whose PostgreSQL type is DATE/TIMESTAMP. These B-tree indexes help with range queries (e.g., all transactions in a date range) because B-trees handle range filters efficiently. If the table has a `timestamp` or `date` column, indexing it can significantly speed up time-based analytics queries.
* **Composite indexes:** If certain combinations of columns are commonly queried together, a multi-column index can be beneficial. The script provides an example by creating a composite index on `(id_column, date_column)` pairs, under the assumption that a typical query might restrict an ID (account, customer, etc.) **and** a date range (e.g., “find all transactions for customer X in Jan 2025”). A composite index on (customer\_id, transaction\_date) would allow such a query to use an index scan that first filters by customer\_id and then by date efficiently. According to PostgreSQL guidelines, multi-column indexes should be used judiciously – the planner can often combine single-column indexes using bitmap index scans for multi-condition queries. However, when a query pattern always involves the same two (or more) columns, a composite index can outperform separate indexes. We create these composite indexes only for certain obvious cases (each `_id` with each date column), but in practice you would tailor this to known query patterns. *(For example, if `account_id` and `transaction_date` are frequently used together in `WHERE` clauses, an index on (account\_id, transaction\_date) is created. This index can be used for queries filtering by account\_id alone (using the leading column) and for queries filtering by both account\_id and date. It would not help a query filtering only by date without account, but we already have a separate index on the date for that.)*

All indexes are created as **B-tree** (the default type) since that is optimal for the equality and range queries we anticipate. The script uses `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` to avoid errors if an index already exists (e.g., if the script is re-run). Each index creation is logged.

## Robust Error Handling and Logging

The script is designed for production reliability. We use Python’s `logging` module to record informational messages and errors during each step. Logging at INFO level provides a trace of the workflow (e.g., when a table is being processed, when data load starts/ends, when indexes are created). Errors are caught with try/except blocks around key operations. For example, if a copybook file can’t be read or parsed, or if a SQL execution fails, the script logs an **error** with details and moves on to the next file, rather than aborting the entire run. This way one badly-formed dataset won’t prevent others from loading. We also catch exceptions during the Spark JDBC write and index creation – any exceptions will be logged with the table name and error message for troubleshooting. The `logger.error()` statements include the exception information, and could be extended to include stack traces if needed (using `logger.exception()` or `traceback` module). In a Databricks notebook, these logs would appear in the driver logs or notebook output, aiding in monitoring the job’s progress.

We ensure that database connections are properly closed in a `finally` block after all processing, to avoid any resource leaks. In summary, the script’s flow is fully instrumented with logs and is resilient to individual failures, aligning with best practices for data pipelines (e.g., explicit exception handling and logging for insights into pipeline performance).

Below is the complete Python script, formatted for a Databricks notebook (it can be placed in a single notebook cell or modularized as needed). You can run this script in a Databricks environment with an active Spark session. Make sure to replace the placeholder values for the PostgreSQL connection (`<HOST>`, `<PORT>`, `<DBNAME>`, `<USERNAME>`, `<PASSWORD>`) with actual credentials, or configure them via secret scope. Also ensure the PostgreSQL JDBC driver is available (e.g., by specifying it in `spark.jars.packages`). The script will log its progress and any issues encountered.

This script will: 

1. **Parse each copybook** (using the cp037 codec for EBCDIC:contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}) and map COBOL data types to PostgreSQL types as described (leveraging standard mappings:contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}:contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}). 
2. **Infer primary keys** using naming conventions:contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39} and construct a CREATE TABLE statement with those keys. 
3. **Execute the DDL** on the PostgreSQL database (dropping existing table if overwrite mode). 
4. **Load the Parquet data** into the PostgreSQL table via Spark’s JDBC data source:contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}. 
5. **Create indexes** on key columns (IDs, dates) to optimize query performance, using B-tree indexes by default:contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41} and composite indexes for combined filters:contentReference[oaicite:42]{index=42}. 
6. **Log each step** and handle errors gracefully, so any issues are recorded and the loop continues with the next file:contentReference[oaicite:43]{index=43}:contentReference[oaicite:44]{index=44}. 

Keep in mind that you may need to adjust the heuristics or mappings for your specific data (for example, if the copybook has more complex structures like OCCURS or REDEFINES, or if certain fields should be treated as dates explicitly). The indexing strategy can also be tuned to the actual workload. Nonetheless, this script provides a solid framework for automating the ingestion of mainframe data (defined by COBOL copybooks) into a relational database with appropriate schema and performance considerations.
