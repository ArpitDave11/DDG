Thanks! I’ll now create a Databricks-compatible RAG pipeline using LangChain, OpenAI, and Chroma (instead of FAISS), that loads precomputed JSON embeddings from DBFS. The script will:

* Install only allowed packages (compatible with private repo or standard PyPI)
* Load pre-embedded JSON from DBFS
* Use Chroma in-memory as the vector store
* Use LangChain’s RetrievalQA with OpenAI’s GPT model
* Output answers and metadata into a pandas DataFrame for analysis

I’ll let you know once the notebook-style script is ready.

# MAGIC Assume the enriched JSON files are stored in a DBFS directory. Each JSON file contains a list of records, each with an entity's metadata (e.g. `entity_name`, `table_name`) and a list of attributes. Each attribute has a precomputed embedding vector and possibly additional info (such as attribute name and value).
# MAGIC

# MAGIC ## 3. Build Chroma Vector Store from Precomputed Embeddings
# MAGIC Next, we create an in-memory Chroma vector store and insert all attribute embeddings. We do **not** recompute embeddings; instead, we directly use the provided 1536-dimensional vectors for each attribute:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For each attribute, we prepare a document text and metadata. The document text combines the entity name and attribute (and its value, if available) to give the LLM useful context, while metadata stores identifiers (entity name, table name, attribute name). We then add these to a Chroma collection using the precomputed embeddings.

Great. I’ll prepare a complete walkthrough for setting up a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using OpenAI and LangChain, with your attribute embeddings stored in pgvector. It will include:

* How to load your enriched JSON or CSV into LangChain
* How to connect to pgvector as a vector store
* How to index and retrieve embedded attributes
* How to build a retriever and chain it with OpenAI’s language models for answering questions

I’ll let you know once it’s ready.


# Implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline with LangChain, OpenAI, and pgvector

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique where an LLM is supplemented with external knowledge retrieved from a vector database, ensuring answers are grounded in the provided context. Instead of relying solely on the model's parameters, relevant information is fetched (using semantic similarity search) and fed into the prompt, giving the model the best chance to generate an accurate response. In our case, the external knowledge consists of data model attribute descriptions (e.g., "Customer Credit Limit") that have been embedded as high-dimensional vectors via OpenAI’s `text-embedding-3-small` model. The pgvector extension for PostgreSQL will serve as our vector store, allowing us to perform similarity search on these embeddings directly within Postgres. By combining pgvector with LangChain’s framework, we can easily orchestrate the embedding retrieval and LLM query steps – unlocking a powerful RAG pipeline for semantic queries over database attributes.

**Tech Stack Overview:**

* **LangChain** – Orchestrates the chain of retrieval and generation (providing `VectorStore` integration, `Retriever` abstraction, and `RetrievalQA` chain).
* **OpenAI Embeddings & LLM** – Generates vector embeddings for text (using OpenAI’s models) and answers questions (using GPT-3.5 Turbo / GPT-4 via OpenAI API).
* **PostgreSQL + pgvector** – Stores embeddings in a `VECTOR` column and enables efficient similarity search in SQL. Our pgvector table already contains embedded representations (1536-dimensional vectors) of each attribute's description or metadata, along with fields identifying the attribute (model, entity, table, column, etc.).

Below, we walk through setting up the RAG pipeline step by step, including Python code snippets and explanations for each component of the system.

## 1. Setting Up the PGVector Database Connection

First, ensure you have a PostgreSQL database with the **pgvector** extension enabled (e.g., `CREATE EXTENSION vector;`). The pgvector extension allows Postgres to store vector embeddings and run nearest-neighbor searches on them. In our scenario, we assume a table already exists (or will be created) to hold embeddings for data model attributes. This table (say, `attribute_embeddings`) has a `VECTOR(1536)` column for the embedding (since OpenAI’s `text-embedding-3-small` produces 1536-dimensional vectors) and additional columns for metadata like `model_name`, `entity_name`, `table_name`, `attribute_name`, etc., as described.

Next, install the necessary Python packages (if not already installed):

```bash
pip install langchain langchain_postgres langchain_openai psycopg[binary]
```

The `langchain_postgres` package provides the `PGVector` vector store integration, and `langchain_openai` provides easy access to OpenAI’s models. You'll also need to set your OpenAI API key (e.g., via the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable or using `os.environ` in code).

Now, let's connect to the PostgreSQL database using LangChain’s PGVector integration:

```python
import os
from langchain_postgres import PGVector
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

# Set OpenAI API key (assuming it's stored in an environment variable)
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>"

# Initialize the OpenAI embedding model (text-embedding-3-small)
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small")

# Define Postgres connection details and collection name
connection_str = "postgresql+psycopg://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>:<PORT>/<DBNAME>"
collection_name = "attribute_collection"  # name for our vector collection

# Connect to (or create) the PGVector vector store
vector_store = PGVector(
    embeddings=embeddings,
    collection_name=collection_name,
    connection=connection_str,
    embedding_length=1536,  # specify dimensionality of embeddings
    use_jsonb=True          # store metadata in a JSONB column
)
```

In the above code:

* We create an `OpenAIEmbeddings` instance for the same model that was used to embed our data (ensuring compatibility). The `text-embedding-3-small` model returns 1536-dimensional vectors.
* We supply a Postgres connection string (using the `psycopg` driver as required by `langchain_postgres`) and a `collection_name`. **Note:** The `collection_name` is **not** the literal table name, but an identifier used by LangChain; it will create underlying tables if they don't exist.
* We pass `embedding_length=1536` so that PGVector knows the vector size (this is optional but needed to build an index; without it, the vector column can’t be indexed properly). We also set `use_jsonb=True` to store metadata fields (like attribute names, table names, etc.) in a JSONB column for flexibility.

Once this runs, `vector_store` is a LangChain vector store object backed by our Postgres/pgvector table. If the collection tables did not exist, they will be created at this point (ensure your DB user has permission to create tables). If the tables already exist (because we previously inserted embeddings), the code will reuse them without reinitializing (since we did not set `pre_delete_collection=True` by default).

## 2. Loading Precomputed Embeddings and Metadata

Since our data model attributes were already embedded and saved (e.g., from JSON/CSV), we need to load these into the vector store. There are two scenarios:

1. **Use existing PG data:** If you have already inserted the embeddings into the pgvector table (via a prior script or ETL process), the `PGVector` initialization above can utilize them directly. We could also explicitly connect to an existing index using `PGVector.from_existing_index(...)` to ensure no new data is added. For example:

   ```python
   vector_store = PGVector.from_existing_index(
       embedding=embeddings,
       collection_name=collection_name,
       connection=connection_str
   )
   ```

   This will load the existing vector collection without trying to reinsert documents (it assumes the table for `collection_name` is already populated).

2. **Load from JSON/CSV:** If you have the embeddings and metadata in files and need to insert them, you can read those files and add to the vector store. For instance, if `attributes.csv` contains columns for `model_name, entity_name, attribute_name, ...` and a serialized vector, you could do:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   from langchain_core.documents import Document

   df = pd.read_csv("attributes.csv")
   docs = []
   for _, row in df.iterrows():
       # Construct a text description for the attribute as the content
       content = f"{row['attribute_name']} - {row['table_name']} ({row['column_data_type']})"
       metadata = {
           "model_name": row["model_name"],
           "entity_name": row["entity_name"],
           "table_name": row["table_name"],
           "attribute_name": row["attribute_name"],
           "column_name": row["column_name"],
           "column_data_type": row["column_data_type"],
           "pk": row["pk"]
       }
       docs.append(Document(page_content=content, metadata=metadata))
   # Add documents with their embeddings (assuming embeddings are precomputed or will be computed)
   vector_store.add_documents(documents=docs)
   ```

   In practice, if the embeddings are precomputed and available (e.g., as a list of floats in the CSV/JSON), you might use `PGVector.from_embeddings()` to bulk insert without re-generating embeddings. The above example illustrates creating `Document` objects with metadata and adding them, letting LangChain handle embedding each `page_content` via the OpenAI model. The `page_content` could be a descriptive sentence of the attribute or just the attribute name; and we store the identifying fields in `metadata` (these will be saved as JSONB in the vector store).

After this step, our `vector_store` contains all attribute embeddings along with their metadata. Each entry in the vector store corresponds to one attribute (one row from the table) and knows, for example, its attribute name and which table/entity it belongs to. We are now ready to query this store semantically.

## 3. Configuring a Semantic Search Retriever

With the vector store ready, we create a **retriever**. A retriever is an interface that, given a user query (text), will return the most relevant documents (in our case, attribute entries) from the vector store. LangChain makes this easy: we can call `vector_store.as_retriever()` to get a retriever object tied to our data. We also specify how many results (`k`) to fetch and any other search parameters. For example:

```python
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(search_kwargs={"k": 5})
```

This configures the retriever to return the top-5 most similar attribute entries for a given query (by default, similarity is measured via cosine distance on the embeddings). Under the hood, when we use the retriever, LangChain will:

1. Take the input query (e.g., *"Which attributes define customer credit limits?"*).
2. Embed the query text into a 1536-D vector using the same OpenAI model.
3. Perform a similarity search in the PGVector store to find the nearest stored embeddings (i.e. the most semantically similar attribute descriptions).

**Semantic vs. Keyword Search:** Because we're using embeddings, the search can match concepts even if keywords differ. For example, a keyword search for "credit limit" might miss an attribute described as "maximum credit allowed", but a vector-based search will find it due to semantic similarity. This means the retriever can identify relevant attributes even if the question’s phrasing doesn't exactly match the column names.

We can further refine retrieval:

* **Max Marginal Relevance (MMR):** To diversify results, you can use `search_type="mmr"` in `as_retriever`. This enables Max Marginal Relevance, which returns results that are relevant **and** mutually diverse. For instance:

  ```python
  retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(
      search_type="mmr",
      search_kwargs={"k": 5, "lambda_mult": 0.5}
  )
  ```

  The `lambda_mult` parameter adjusts the diversity vs. relevance trade-off. An MMR retriever will ensure the fetched attributes cover different facets, which can be useful if many attributes have similar content.
* **Metadata Filters:** If we want to restrict the search to certain criteria (e.g. only attributes from the "Customer" entity), we can apply a metadata filter. For example:

  ```python
  retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(
      search_kwargs={
          "k": 5,
          "filter": {"entity_name": "Customer"}
      }
  )
  ```

  This filter ensures only documents whose metadata field `entity_name` is "Customer" will be considered in the similarity search. LangChain's PGVector retriever supports such filtering on the stored metadata (metadata was stored in JSONB when we added the documents).

At this point, we have a `retriever` that can fetch the most relevant attribute entry (or entries) for any natural language query. Next, we’ll use this retriever in a QA chain with an LLM to generate answers.

## 4. Building the RetrievalQA Chain with OpenAI LLM

With our retriever in hand, we can construct a **RetrievalQA** chain. This LangChain chain will take a user question, use the retriever to get relevant context, and then prompt an LLM (OpenAI GPT model) to generate an answer using that context.

We'll use OpenAI's chat model for the answer generation. For example, let's choose GPT-3.5 Turbo via LangChain's `ChatOpenAI` interface:

```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

# Initialize the OpenAI chat model (e.g., GPT-3.5 Turbo)
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)

# Create the RetrievalQA chain
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    chain_type="stuff",     # "Stuff" the retrieved docs into the prompt
    retriever=retriever
)
```

Here, `chain_type="stuff"` means that the chain will simply insert the retrieved documents (our attribute descriptions) into the prompt for the LLM, usually appending them after the user’s question. This is a straightforward approach: the LLM sees the raw text of the top retrieved entries and uses them to formulate its answer. The assumption is that the combined length of the question plus the retrieved text stays within the model's context window. If we had a lot of or very large documents, we might need more sophisticated chain types (like `"map_reduce"` or `"refine"`) to summarize or iterate over pieces of context, but for concise attribute definitions, "stuff" is ideal.

We set `temperature=0` for the LLM to make its output deterministic and focused (important for Q\&A tasks where accuracy is key). You could also use `OpenAI()` from `langchain.llms` for a standard completion model, but `ChatOpenAI` with GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 is recommended for chat-based Q\&A scenarios.

At this stage, our RAG pipeline is ready: the `qa_chain` will handle taking a user query, retrieving relevant attribute info via the retriever, and then generating an answer with the OpenAI model.

## 5. Running a Sample Query

Let's test the pipeline with a sample question. Suppose we ask: **"Which attributes define customer credit limits?"**. We will use our `qa_chain` to answer this:

```python
query = "Which attributes define customer credit limits?"
result = qa_chain.run(query)
print(result)
```

When this is executed, the chain will:

* **Embed the query** and perform a similarity search in the PGVector store.
* **Retrieve** one or more entries such as the *Credit Limit* attribute of the **Customer** entity (and any related attributes that mention credit limits).
* **Pass** the text of those attribute entries into the GPT model, along with the question.
* The **LLM generates** an answer using the provided context.

For example, if our data model had an attribute **Customer.CreditLimit** (with a description like "Maximum credit amount allowed for the customer"), the output might be:

> *"The Customer entity includes a **CreditLimit** attribute, which defines the maximum amount of credit that can be extended to a customer. This attribute effectively sets each customer’s credit limit in the system."*

This answer was generated by the model, but it’s grounded in the retrieved data – specifically, the presence of a "CreditLimit" attribute in the Customer table metadata. The retrieval-augmented approach ensures the model only states what the data provides (in this case, identifying the relevant attribute and its meaning), rather than relying on its own potentially inaccurate prior knowledge.

You can modify the query and expect the pipeline to return relevant attribute information. For instance, a query like *"What is the primary key of the Customer table?"* would cause the retriever to find whichever attribute is marked as the primary key (`pk`) for the Customer entity in the metadata, and the LLM’s answer would incorporate that detail (e.g. "*The Customer table’s primary key is the **CustomerID** attribute*").

## 6. Enhancing Retrieval with Chunking and Metadata

Our basic RAG pipeline is functional, but there are additional enhancements and best practices to consider:

* **Chunking Long Documents:** If any attribute descriptions or documentation were very large, it would be wise to split them into smaller chunks before embedding. LangChain provides utilities like `TextSplitter` to break text into chunks of a specified token length. By chunking, each piece of text stays within the model’s context window and retrieval can return just the relevant chunk. In our attribute use-case, descriptions are likely short, so this isn't a concern. But for other RAG scenarios (e.g. processing lengthy policies or manuals), chunking is essential to avoid truncation and to improve focus.
* **Metadata-Guided Answers:** We demonstrated simple metadata filtering for retrieval. You can also use metadata in the prompt to guide the LLM’s answer. For example, you might store a source or `origin` for each attribute (like which data model or revision it came from) and then modify the `RetrievalQA` prompt template so that the LLM includes that source in its response. This can help provide provenance for the answers. LangChain’s chains are customizable with prompt templates, enabling you to inject such instructions or formatting (e.g., *"Include the table name for each attribute in the answer"*).
* **Indexing and Performance:** For production use with many vectors, ensure you create an index on the vector column in Postgres for efficient similarity search. Pgvector supports multiple index types (like HNSW and IVFFlat) for approximate nearest neighbors. Creating an index (e.g. using HNSW for cosine distance) will significantly speed up retrieval on large datasets. In SQL, for example:

  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX ON attribute_embeddings USING hnsw (embedding vector_cosine_ops);
  ```

  This step isn't handled by LangChain itself, but it’s important to do in Postgres for scalability. After creating an index, pgvector will use it to answer similarity queries much faster, especially as your number of attributes grows.
* **Alternate Distance Metrics:** By default, LangChain’s PGVector uses cosine similarity (which is a good choice for text embeddings). If your use-case prefers a different distance metric (pgvector also supports L2, inner product, etc.), you can specify that via the `distance_strategy` parameter when initializing the vector store. Ensure the index you create matches the distance metric (e.g., use `vector_l2_ops` for L2 distance).

By implementing these enhancements as needed, you can improve the accuracy and efficiency of your RAG system. The end result is a robust pipeline where an OpenAI LLM can answer questions about your **data model** by leveraging the semantic knowledge encoded in pgvector – providing precise, context-aware answers that would be hard to get with simple keyword search alone.
