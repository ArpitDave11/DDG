Overall Goal
Refactor the VM-selection logic to isolate it in its own function, integrate file-processing notifications, and centralize status logging into a Delta file—all without affecting any unrelated code paths.

VM Selection
New helper:
Create a function, e.g. selectAvailableVM(vmList), that:
Iterates over the provided list of VM objects.
Pings each VM (3 s timeout).
Returns an object containing:
ipAddress: the reachable VM’s IP
nickname: the VM’s friendly name or alias
If none respond, returns null (or throws a “No reachable VM” error).
Integration:
In the existing entry point (formerly hard-coded to VM1), replace the ping logic with a single call to selectAvailableVM(...).
Use its returned ipAddress and nickname downstream—no other code should change.
Trigger & File Processing
Trigger listener:
Hook into your event source (e.g., Azure Service Bus or Event Grid) to get the list of files to process.
Per-file workflow:
For each incoming file:
Check if it’s already processed (optional dedupe).
Process the file payload.
Determine outcome: success or failure.
Rename or tag the file by appending _success or _failure to its name.
Send a notification (e.g., via messaging or log entry) indicating which file ran and its result.
Status Logging to Delta File
Delta file setup:
Path: e.g. /mnt/delta/job_status/ on ADLS Gen2.
Schema:
fileName
jobId
processingTimestamp
status ("success" / "failure")
updateFlag (e.g. Boolean or numeric)
Utility function:
Build logJobStatus(fileName, jobId, status, updateFlag) that:
Creates the Delta file if it doesn’t exist.
Appends a new record with the above schema.
Call sites:
In the “success” branch of your file-processing loop, call logJobStatus(…, "success", …).
In the “failure” branch, call logJobStatus(…, "failure", …).
Parameterization & Clean-Code
No hard-codes:
All values (VM list, file paths, job IDs, timeouts) must come from function parameters or config.
Minimal impact:
Only modify the lines that:
Call the new selectAvailableVM() function.
Invoke logJobStatus().
Append status suffix to file names.
Leave all other logic untouched.
Documentation & Comments
Docstrings:
For each new function (selectAvailableVM, logJobStatus), include a clear docstring:
What it takes in, what it returns, and any exceptions it may throw.
Inline comments:
At the top of each major block (VM selection, trigger handling, file loop, logging), add a brief comment explaining why we’re doing it.
High-level narrative:
In your code repo’s README or at the head of the notebook, include a 3- to 5-sentence overview of the entire flow.
With this structure, anyone reading the code or documentation will immediately understand:

Where VM selection lives and how it works.
How files are picked up, processed, and tagged.
Where and how job statuses are recorded.
What parameters drive each step.
Let me know if any detail needs further tweaking!
