Perfect — you’ve captured the intent very clearly.
Here’s a complete roadmap and structured requirement definition for the GitLab Planner (EPIC Generator) project — integrating both your verbal description and the context extracted earlier from your notes.

⸻

🧭 Project Vision

To build an AI-powered GitLab Planner that automates the creation of EPICs in GitLab by interpreting business requirements, contextual chats, and project metadata, producing a structured EPIC draft + process flow diagram with review & approval capabilities.

The goal is to transform ambiguous planning discussions into actionable GitLab artifacts, using LLMs for drafting, summarization, and visualization.

🧩 Core Modules

1. Landing Page / UI Dashboard

Purpose: Acts as the entry point for business users.

Components:
	•	Options Panel:
	•	Project Name
	•	Initiative / Defect
	•	Use Case
	•	Review checklist
	•	Business Requirements Form: Structured JSON schema capturing metadata for the LLM input.
	•	Visual Design: Modern dashboard with cards for “Create EPIC”, “Edit EPIC”, “View Read-Only”, etc.

⸻

2. Context Window

Purpose: Captures natural language context to help the LLM understand the project better.

Sections:
	•	Chat Panel – accepts structured + unstructured inputs:
	•	Purpose
	•	NFRs (Non-Functional Requirements)
	•	Timelines
	•	Workstreams
	•	AI Planner – converts chat text into structured metadata:
	•	Key deliverables
	•	Dependencies
	•	Constraints
	•	Suggested EPIC summary

⸻

3. AI-Based EPIC Generator

Purpose: Generate a complete GitLab EPIC draft using LLMs.

Inputs:
	•	Business requirement JSON (from UI)
	•	Context (from Chat)
	•	LLM model prompt

Outputs:
	•	EPIC Title and Description
	•	Linked Initiatives / Use Cases
	•	Process Flow Diagram (auto-generated via D2 or Mermaid syntax)
	•	Key metrics (timeline, owner, status)

Actions:
	•	Edit → Allows human refinement.
	•	Review → Enables peer or AI review (grammar, clarity, scope completeness).
	•	Approve → Locks EPIC and pushes to GitLab.

⸻

4. Read-Only Mode

Purpose: Centralized viewer for finalized EPICs and statuses.

Features:
	•	EPIC metadata (title, product, purpose)
	•	Approval status
	•	Links to GitLab EPIC
	•	Visualization pane (showing flow diagrams or relationship trees)
	•	Audit trail (edit → review → approve history)

⸻

5. Integration Layer

Purpose: Connect GitLab Planner with GitLab’s API and AI backends.

Integrations:
	•	GitLab API → Create, read, update EPICs.
	•	OpenAI / Azure OpenAI API → Generate text and diagrams.
	•	Vector DB (optional) → Store reusable context embeddings for consistent EPIC tone and terminology.
	•	User Auth → GitLab OAuth / SSO.

⸻

🧠 AI and Automation Layer
	•	Prompt Engineering: Prebuilt templates for EPIC generation using input metadata.
	•	LLM Roles:
	•	Planner Agent → interprets context.
	•	Reviewer Agent → critiques for clarity.
	•	Visualizer Agent → creates diagrams.
	•	Reflection Loop (optional):
	1.	Generate draft EPIC.
	2.	Review for quality and consistency.
	3.	Auto-suggest improvements.
	4.	Finalize after user confirmation.

⸻

🧾 Workflow Example
	1.	User logs in → opens GitLab Planner.
	2.	Fills Business Requirements (Project, Initiative, Use Case, etc.).
	3.	Adds Chat Context (Purpose, NFRs, Timelines, Workstreams).
	4.	AI generates EPIC draft + diagram.
	5.	User can Edit / Review / Approve.
	6.	Approved EPIC auto-syncs to GitLab via API.
	7.	Stakeholders access Read-Only EPIC Dashboard.

⸻

🎯 Phased Roadmap

Phase 1 – MVP
	•	UI with “Options” panel + Chat Context input.
	•	Basic LLM integration for EPIC title + description generation.
	•	GitLab API integration to create EPICs.
	•	Simple Read-Only view.

Phase 2 – Smart Planning
	•	Add diagram generator (Mermaid / D2).
	•	Enable “Edit / Review / Approve” flow.
	•	Auto-summarize purpose, scope, and NFRs via AI.

Phase 3 – Collaboration & Governance
	•	Introduce RACI assignment.
	•	AI-based reviewer suggestions.
	•	Read-Only dashboard with progress tracker.

Phase 4 – Intelligent Learning Layer
	•	Use embeddings to learn organizational terminology.
	•	Context persistence: reuse previous project patterns.
	•	“AI Planner Recommendations” for new EPICs.

Would you like me to draft the visual process flow diagram (D2 or Mermaid) for this GitLab Planner architecture next?
It would show — Options → Context → AI Planner → EPIC Generator → Review → Approval → GitLab Sync → Read-Only.
