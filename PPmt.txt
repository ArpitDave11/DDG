"I need assistance with creating an end-to-end project utilizing OpenAI's generative AI model deployed on Azure to generate descriptions based on the attributes of a table. Here are the details:

1. **Source Data**:
   - I have a PDF containing data with existing descriptions.
   - Another target table contains attributes; some already have descriptions, while others lack them.

2. **Objective**:
   - Use the PDF data to train the LLM to understand the pattern and context of existing descriptions.
   - Automatically generate descriptions for attributes in the target table wherever descriptions are missing, using insights from the training.

3. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Utilize OpenAI's LLM integrated with Azure services.
   - Leverage Azure endpoints for API calls to process the data and generate results.

4. **Challenges**:
   - The PDF data needs to be extracted and processed.
   - Schema for the other table is loaded but requires integration for description generation.

5. **Deliverables**:
   - Detailed project implementation steps from start to finish.
   - Code snippets for data extraction, processing, integration, and description generation.
   - Workflow design for utilizing the OpenAI LLM and Azure endpoints.
   - Examples showcasing the process and outputs.

6. **Scope**:
   - The project should incorporate Azure services efficiently.
   - Guidance on handling the PDF and schema data, ensuring smooth integration.

Please provide a comprehensive solution, including code, methodology, and any additional recommendations for completing this project."
